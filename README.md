* Implementing contingency plans in case the website goes down
* Maintaining and expanding/enhancing the website once built
* Researching different software programs, maintaining software documentation
* Developing or validating test routines and schedules to ensure that test cases mimic external interfaces and address all browser and device types.
* Evaluating code to ensure it meets industry standards, is valid, is properly structured, and is compatible with browsers, devices, or operating systems.
