## The Basics

### Who are Web Developers?
Web Developers are people who design and build websites. They are responsible for the coding, design and layout of a website’s appearance and its technical aspects. This includes its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website’s speed and how much traffic the site can handle.

### **Web Developer Responsibilities**
* Website and software application designing, building, or maintaining.
* Using scripting or authoring languages, management tools, content creation tools, applications, and digital media.
* Implementing contingency plans in case the website goes down
* Maintaining and expanding/enhancing the website once built
* Researching different software programs, maintaining software documentation
* Developing or validating test routines and schedules to ensure that test cases mimic external interfaces and address all browser and device types.
* Evaluating code to ensure it meets industry standards, is valid, is properly structured, and is compatible with browsers, devices, or operating systems.
* Determining user needs by analyzing technical requirements.
* Directing or performing Website updates.

There are also specialized web developers such as:
**Back-end web developers**: They are responsible for the overall technical construction of the website.
**Front-end web developers**: They are reponsible for how a website looks. 
**Webmaster**: They are responsible to maintain websites and keep them updated.

### **Required Education**

Educational requirements for web developers varey between the setting they work in and what type of work they do. Requirements can **range** from a **high school diploma** to a **bachelor’s degree**. An **associate’s degree** in web design or related field is the most **common** requirement. 

However, for **specialized developer** positions, such as back-end web developers, sine employers would prefer people who have at least **bachelor’s degree** in computer science, programming, or a related field.
