### **Web Developer Responsibilities:**
* Website and software application designing, building, or maintaining.
* Using scripting or authoring languages, management tools, content creation tools, applications, and digital media.
* Implementing contingency plans in case the website goes down
* Maintaining and expanding/enhancing the website once built
* Researching different software programs, maintaining software documentation
* Developing or validating test routines and schedules to ensure that test cases mimic external interfaces and address all browser and device types.
* Evaluating code to ensure it meets industry standards, is valid, is properly structured, and is compatible with browsers, devices, or operating systems.
* Determining user needs by analyzing technical requirements.
* Directing or performing Website updates.

There are also specialized web developers such as:
**Back-end web developers**: They are responsible for the overall technical construction of the website.
**Front-end web developers**: They are reponsible for how a website looks. 
**Webmaster**: They are responsible to maintain websites and keep them updated.
