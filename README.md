## The Basics

Web Developers are people who design and build websites. They are responsible for the coding, design and layout of a website’s appearance and its technical aspects. This includes its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website’s speed and how much traffic the site can handle.

## Web Developer Responsibilities
* Website and software application designing, building, or maintaining.
* Using scripting or authoring languages, management tools, content creation tools, applications, and digital media.
* Implementing contingency plans in case the website goes down
* Maintaining and expanding/enhancing the website once built

* Evaluating code to ensure it meets industry standards, is valid, is properly structured, and is compatible with browsers, devices, or operating systems.
* Determining user needs by analyzing technical requirements.
* Directing or performing Website updates.
